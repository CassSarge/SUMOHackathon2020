## Neural Network
The neural network can be loaded from a variety of pretrained models, including:
- VGG16
- ResNet50
- MobileNet

The script then grabs a frame from the computers default webcam and highlights a region of interest. This region will be passed to the classifier and our model will predict the most likely ASL fingerspelt alphabet.
